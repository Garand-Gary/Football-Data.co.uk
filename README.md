# [Football-Data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk/) API

## About
This is my library for accessing the fixture data and historical results data from the amazing and free football-data.co.uk.

The source website offers vast amounts of historic data, including match statistics and betting odds, in CSV format. There is also a CSV of upcoming fixtures. The aim of this library is to make accessing this data in your .NET applications easier by taking the hassle of processing CSV data away and instead returning useful objects.

## Using the library
To do so, simply download and build the solution in Visual Studio, or add the main project to your own solution. The resultant assembly should have all public methods documented in IntelliSense and hopefully everything is self-explanatory but if not, please let me know. I hope it goes without saying that an internet connection is required to use the library, as the data needs to be collected from football-data.co.uk.

The aim is to make this available via NuGet which will make life even easier.

## Support
I have made this library for purely selfish reasons - mainly as a learning experience, and also with one eye on a future project. However if anyone else ends up using it I will be delighted, and I am more than happy to answer any requests for help via GitHub.

This is my first such project and as a result I am sure it is far from perfect. I've learned a lot but I want to learn more so any feature requests, tips, suggestions, criticisms or code contributions are welcome.

Cheers!
Gary
